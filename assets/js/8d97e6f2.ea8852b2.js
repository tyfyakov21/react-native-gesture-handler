If it does, it's put to the waiting list, if it doesn't, it gets activated and all other gestures (that are not simultaneous with it) get cancelled. When a gesture handlers transitions to a finished state (the gesture recognized by it stops, it fails or gets cancelled) the orchestrator check the waiting handlers.
